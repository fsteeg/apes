%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 A Prolog Expert System (APES)
 http://apes.sourceforge.net/
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

Running:

0. install swi-prolog (should work on any ISO-Standard Prolog Interpreter, but this is untested)
1. run "swipl -f main.pl"
2. enter "start."

On questions, answer "yes."/"no."/"why." or "y."/"n."/"w."

Queries:

3. Consult the expert: "what is Object-A?" 
4. Consult the expert using a specified property: "is Object-A a bird?"
5. Query a fact, knowing the group: "is a dog a pet?"
6. Query a group: "show group pet."

Build up the Knowledge:

7. Add a rule: 
- using facts to be asked or given (with "has"):
 	"if animal has scales and animal has cold-blood then animal is a reptile."
- using existing rules (with "is a"):
	"if animal is a reptile and animal has enormous-size 
	and animal has hollywood-fame then animal is a godzilla."
8. Add a fact: "hamster is a pet." or "add hamster to pet."
9. Create a new group: "create group feline."

Rules are stored in "knowledge/knowledge.pl", facts in individual files for each group in "knowledge/groups".

Todo:

- Make input more flexible
- Improve cli feeling, reaction
- Add online help to cli (display this file)
- Info on startup, on the help available
- Number rules added from the cli, for info on display of inference
- Call from Java or Ruby to make it usable from other apps and languages
