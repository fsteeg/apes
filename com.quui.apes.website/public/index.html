<p><b>A Prolog expert system (APES) supporting querying and
extending the knowledge base from a command-line interface using a
format oriented on natural language, with the aim of being maintainable
by the domain expert (i.e. without requiring programming skills).</b></p>

<!-- h3> Details </h3> -->
<p>The system can be queried like this: <code>"What is
Object-01?"</code> or <code>"Is Object-A a bird?"</code>. The sytem will search
the rules and facts in the knowledge base and request missing facts from
the user. When a solution is found, the inference that lead to the
conclusion (i.e. the used rules and facts) and additional solutions can
be displayed.</p>
<p>In a similar manner the knowledge base can be extended from the
command-line interface: <code>"if animal has backbone and animal
has cold-blood then animal is a reptile."</code> adds a new rule using facts
(indicated by <code>"has"</code>) that will be searched for and asked
from the user. The added rules can be used in rules again (using <code>"is
a"</code>): <code>"if animal is a reptile and animal has enormous-size
and animal has hollywood-fame then animal is a godzilla."</code>, now when the
system is queryed <code>"is Object-A a godzilla?"</code> it will first
try to satisfy the rule for reptile that was entered before.</p>
<p>The input format is defined as a Definite Clause Grammar (DCG), a
grammar description language built into Prolog, and is therefore
well-defined and extensible. The knowledge is represented in text files
containing Prolog predicates with defined operators to make it a
domain-specific language which is not too far from the actual input
format, making it maintainable by the domain expert without requiring
Prolog or general programming skills.</p>
<p>This leads to the core idea and goal: An expert system where the
knowledge base can not only be <i>queried</i> by the domain expert, but
can also be <i>built and maintained</i> without requiring programming
skills, making this a non-domain-specific expert system that could be
used to built expert systems for any domain by experts in that
particular domain, not by programmers.</p>
