<b> Short description </b>
<p>A Prolog expert system supporting querying and extending the
knowledge base from a command-line interface using a format oriented on
natural language, with the aim of being maintainable by the domain
expert (i.e. without requiring programming skills).</p>
<hr size="1" />
<b> Details </b>
<p>This is a Prolog expert system using an input format oriented on
natural language. The system can be queried like this: "What is
Object-01?" or "Is Object-A a bird?". The sytem will search the rules
and facts in the knowledge base and request missing facts from the user.
When a solution is found, the inference that lead to the conclusion
(i.e. the used rules and facts) and additional solutions can be
displayed.</p>
<p>In a similar manner the knowledge base can be extended from the
command-line interface: "if animal has backbone and animal has
cold-blood then animal is a reptile." adds a new rule using facts
(indicated by "has") that will be searched for and asked from the user.
The added rules can be used in rules again (using "is a"): "if animal is
a reptile and animal has enormous-size and animal has hollywood-fame
then animal is a godzilla.", now when the system is queryed like "Is
Object-A a godzilla?" it will first try to satisfy the rule for reptile
that was entered before.</p>
<p>The input format is defined as a Definite Clause Grammar (DCG), a
grammar description language built into Prolog, and is therefore
well-defined and extensible. The knowledge is represented in text files
containing Prolog predicates with defined operators to make it a
domain-specific language which is not too far from the actual input
format, making it maintainable by the domain expert without requiring
Prolog or general programming skills.</p>
<p>This leads to the core idea and goal: An expert system where the
knowledge base can not only be queried by the domain expert, but can
also be built and maintained without requiring programming skills,
making this a non-domain-specific expert system that could be used to
built expert systems for any domain by experts in that particular
domain, not by programmers.</p>
